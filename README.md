# SQL-TO-DO-LIST

## A SQL-DB BASED PHOTO GALLERY

_Duration: 1 DAY sprint_

This app accesses and renders photos from a sql database to the DOM. Users can click the photo to see a description of the image, and can click like to show their preference for a photo. Likes are stored on the DB.




### Prerequisites



- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- express
- bodyParser
- pg
- nodemon

## Installation


1. Create a database named `react_gallery`,
2. The queries in the `database.sql` file are set up to create all the necessary tables and populate the needed data to allow the application to run correctly. The project is built on [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/download/), so you will need to make sure to have that installed. We recommend using Postico to run those queries as that was used to create the queries, 
3. Open up your editor of choice and run an `npm install`
4. Run `npm run server` in your terminal
5. Run `npm run client` in your terminal
6. The `npm run client` command will open up a new browser tab for you!
